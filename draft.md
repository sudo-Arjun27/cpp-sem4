This repository contains my college practical programs along with self-practice exercises that I work on while learning and improving my technical skills.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Maintain a structured record of college practicals
- Practice concepts beyond the syllabus
- Track my learning progress over time
- Build a strong foundation through hands-on coding
